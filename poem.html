            <p> So, three months, huh? You’ve got me messed up good </p>
            
            <p>too damn pretty, that brain of yours a blade,</p>
            <p>puzzles I suck at, but you just smirk and stay. </p>
            <p> You’re wild, like,who let her loose? and I’m here for it,</p>
            <p> cracking jokes ‘til my sides hurt, your eyes all lit.</p>
            <p> We talk forever, late nights, spilling dumb secrets,</p>
            <p> then bam—sometimes it’s heavy, quiet, legit.</p>
            <p> You’re hot, no lie, like I’m staring too long,</p>
            <p> that crazy streak? Keeps me guessing, off track.</p>
            <p> We’re good, we’re golden, then sad outta nowhere</p>
            <p> still, I’m hooked, no taking that back.</p>
            <p>You know I’ve got someone, you don’t even blink,</p>
            <p> You’re a mess, but so am I, so it’s cool,</p>
            <p> just pull me closer with that look, that grin</p>
            <p>girl, you’re a spark I shouldn’t play with, </p>
            <p> but damn, you’re my favorite sin.</p>
            <p> I’d say you’re trouble, but I’m the one tripping,</p>
            <p> chasing your vibe like it’s all I need to breathe.</p>
            <p> Smart, gorgeous, nuts, you’ve got me spinning,</p>
            <p> and I’m not even trying to leave.</p>
